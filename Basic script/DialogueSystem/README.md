That's great! But if you need diferent characters talking... I supose that we need to do  transform the variable "Dialogue" (from DialogueTrigger script) in a Array (like this "Dialogue [ ]" ).
But... How can we do for Start the next Dialogue? I supose we must create a function in DialogueManager script, but I don't know what to do... :'(
